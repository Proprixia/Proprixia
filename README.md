- 👋 Hi, I’m @Proprixia
- 👀 I’m interested in decentralized networking, research, data science, and making code that improves society.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning C and several important libraries for it, while also branching out into Rustlang.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate with people who share any similar interests, just reach out!
